        "description": "Goldman Sachs is one of the world's largest and most influential investment banks, founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman, a German Jewish immigrant, in New York City. His son-in-law Samuel Sachs joined in 1882. The firm has been central to global finance for over 150 years and has produced numerous US Treasury Secretaries including Robert Rubin, Hank Paulson, and Steven Mnuchin. Goldman has deep ties to Jewish communal life; many of its senior leaders have been prominent Jewish philanthropists. The firm played a controversial role in the 2008 financial crisis, profiting from the housing market collapse through credit default swaps while selling mortgage-backed securities to clients - leading to a $550 million SEC settlement. Goldman was also heavily involved in the 1MDB Malaysian sovereign wealth fund scandal, paying $2.9 billion in fines for its role in facilitating over $4.5 billion in fraudulent bond sales. The firm has significant operations in Israel, with a major office in Herzliya. Goldman alumni include Mario Draghi (former ECB president), Mark Carney (former Bank of England governor), and numerous CEOs across finance.",

It convenes the leadership of organizations spanning the political spectrum from the Zionist Organization of America to Americans for Peace Now. The Conference organizes high-level missions to Israel, arranges meetings between Jewish leaders and heads of state, and issues consensus statements on critical issues. It has been led by influential figures including Malcolm Hoenlein, its long-serving executive vice chairman from 1986 to 2022, who shaped the organization into a major diplomatic player. The Conference has faced internal tensions over political diversity, including a controversial 2014 vote that blocked the admission of J Street, highlighting deep divisions over Israel policy within the Jewish community.",

Its annual policy conference draws 15,000-20,000 attendees including a majority of Congress. In 2022, AIPAC launched the United Democracy Project super PAC, spending over $100 million in the 2022 and 2024 cycles. The AIPAC PAC directly endorses candidates. AIPAC helped secure the $38B 10-year military aid MOU (2016), annual Iron Dome funding, and anti-BDS legislation in 35+ states. In 2005, employees Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman were charged under the Espionage Act (charges dropped 2009). In 1992, president David Steiner resigned after a recorded phone call. Critics Mearsheimer and Walt's \"The Israel Lobby\" (2007) focused heavily on AIPAC. The organization has become polarizing, with progressive Democrats openly critical while it maintains strong bipartisan establishment support.",

Founded in 1849 by German-American cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart. The company's Jewish connections became globally prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic through CEO Albert Bourla, a Greek-Jewish veterinarian from Thessaloniki whose parents survived the Holocaust (his father was rescued from a firing line, his mother survived through being hidden by non-Jewish friends). Bourla led Pfizer's rapid development of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with BioNTech, founded by Turkish-German scientists Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci. The vaccine was developed with technology partly based on research by Drew Weissman, a Jewish-American immunologist who won the Nobel Prize in 2023 for the mRNA breakthrough. Pfizer has an extensive Israeli connection: Israel served as a global model for vaccine rollout, with Pfizer signing a data-sharing agreement with the Israeli government making Israel effectively a test case for vaccine efficacy. Pfizer has faced controversies including the $2.3 billion settlement for fraudulent marketing (2009, the largest health care fraud settlement in history), accusations of pandemic profiteering, and drug pricing controversies.",

Iger oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox, making Disney the dominant force in entertainment. The company's founder, Walt Disney, has been accused posthumously of antisemitism, though this remains debated by historians. Disney operates in Israel through its media divisions. Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Jewish executive, was Disney's studio chairman before co-founding DreamWorks.

Bear Stearns was known as a scrappy, entrepreneurial firm with deep Jewish roots - CEO Alan \"Ace\" Greenberg, who ran the firm for decades, was famous for his frugality and charitable giving to Jewish causes. His successor James Cayne was also Jewish. The firm collapsed in March 2008 after a run on its hedge funds exposed to subprime mortgages, and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase for just $10 per share (originally offered $2, later revised) in a deal facilitated by the Federal Reserve. At its peak, Bear Stearns had been valued at over $170 per share. The collapse wiped out employees' life savings and marked the beginning of the broader financial crisis. Former Bear Stearns executive Warren Spector and hedge fund managers Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin faced criminal charges (acquitted) for their roles in the collapse.",

Through aggressive and deceptive marketing of OxyContin (claiming it was less addictive than other opioids, which was false), Purdue Pharma generated over $35 billion in revenue. The Sackler family extracted billions in dividends while knowing of the drug's addictive nature. Purdue pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges in 2020 and agreed to pay over $8 billion. The family negotiated a controversial bankruptcy settlement of $6 billion for personal liability. Prior to the scandal, the Sackler name was prominent in Jewish philanthropy and arts patronage, with galleries at the Met, Guggenheim, Louvre, and Smithsonian named after them.

The Marcus family ran the company for decades; Stanley Marcus, son of Herbert, became legendary in retail as \"the Pope of Fashion.\" The company has been through multiple leveraged buyouts: TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus bought it in 2005, and Ares Management and Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board acquired it in 2013 for $6 billion, loading it with debt. Neiman Marcus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming one of the largest retail bankruptcies in US history. It emerged from bankruptcy in September 2020. The company has faced criticism over its private equity-driven debt load.",

Universal Pictures' founding by Carl Laemmle is one of the foundational stories of Jewish Hollywood - Laemmle used his position to help bring over 300 Jewish families from Germany to the US during the Nazi era, saving their lives.

CEO Larry Fink, who is Jewish, grew up in a Jewish family in Van Nuys, California; his father owned a shoe store and his mother was an English professor.

BlackRock has been the target of conspiracy theories, some with antisemitic overtones. The company has significant Israeli investments and has been both pressured by BDS advocates to divest from Israel and criticized by pro-Israel advocates for ESG policies that some viewed as anti-Israel. Fink's annual chairman's letters are among the most influential documents in global finance. BlackRock has been controversial for its immense influence over corporate governance, its role in the housing market (accused of contributing to housing shortages by purchasing single-family homes), and environmental debates around its ESG investment approach.",

Schultz, who grew up in a Jewish family in the Bayview housing projects of Brooklyn, is one of the most prominent Jewish-American business leaders. His rags-to-riches story became emblematic of the American dream. Schultz has been a significant supporter of Israel; in 2014, he received the \"Botton Heritage Award\" from the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah. He has made public statements supporting Israel and was falsely rumored in 2002 to have made anti-Palestinian remarks (which he denied). Starbucks closed its Israeli stores in 2003, operated by the Delek Group, citing business reasons, but this led to protest and boycott activism on both sides. Schultz briefly explored a 2020 presidential run. The current CEO, Laxman Narasimhan (replaced by Brian Niccol in 2024), oversees continued global expansion. Former executive chairman Howard Schultz stepped down from the board in 2023.",

All three founders are Jewish Americans who previously worked together at Bear Stearns. KKR pioneered the leveraged buyout (LBO) industry and became famous for its 1989 hostile takeover of RJR Nabisco ($25 billion), which was chronicled in the bestseller \"Barbarians at the Gate.\" Henry Kravis and George Roberts are cousins who grew up in Jewish families - Kravis in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Roberts in Houston. The firm manages over $500 billion in assets. KKR has been controversial for its role in defining aggressive financial engineering and the impact of private equity on companies, workers, and communities. Critics argue PE firms like KKR load companies with debt, extract fees, and sometimes lead them to bankruptcy. The firm has also faced criticism for investments in controversial sectors.",

Founded in 1984 by Sanford \"Sandy\" Bernstein, a Jewish-American investor who founded the investment management firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. (later Alliance Bernstein). The foundation operated on a \"spend-down\" model, distributing all assets before closing in 2020 after giving away over $1 billion. AVI CHAI funded Jewish day schools, summer camps, Israel education programs, and birthright trips. It supported Jewish publishing (including the Sefaria online library of Jewish texts), educational technology, and programs bridging religious and secular Israeli communities. The foundation was notable for its strategic approach to philanthropy and its intentional sundown, reflecting Bernstein's belief that each generation should create its own philanthropies.",

The company's Jewish connection centers on its ownership history: in 2016, JAB Holding Company, the investment arm of the Reimann family of Germany, acquired Krispy Kreme for $1.35 billion and took it private before re-listing it in 2021. The Reimann family's connection to this database stems from revelations in 2019 that the family's patriarch, Albert Reimann Sr. and Jr., were committed supporters of Adolf Hitler and used forced labor during the Nazi era, including concentration camp prisoners. The family subsequently pledged $11 million to a charitable fund to address their Nazi past. JAB Holding also controls Peet's Coffee, Panera Bread, and Keurig Dr Pepper. Krispy Kreme operates over 1,400 shops globally and has expanded into Israel. The company went through a major accounting scandal in the early 2000s when executives were charged with inflating earnings.",

Cadbury Schweppes later acquired Snapple, which is now owned by Keurig Dr Pepper.

The organization represents the liberal Zionist perspective: pro-Israel but critical of the occupation and settlement enterprise. APN lobbies Congress, publishes research on settlement growth (its \"Facts on the Ground\" reports are widely cited), and engages American Jewish communities in dialogue about peace. The organization has been controversial within the Jewish community, with critics accusing it of undermining Israeli security and providing ammunition to Israel's detractors. Supporters view it as an essential voice for peace within Zionism. APN's positions have historically aligned with the Israeli Labor Party and the broader Israeli peace camp.",

In 2019, Kraft faced personal controversy when he was charged with soliciting prostitution at a Florida spa (charges later dropped).

The company became a \"meme stock\" during the GameStop saga in 2021-2022, when activist investor Ryan Cohen (also Jewish) took a large stake, only to sell it abruptly, leading to accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme. CFO Gustavo Arnal fell to his death from a New York City skyscraper in 2022 amid the stock's collapse, in what was ruled a suicide.

        "description": "Häagen-Dazs is a premium ice cream brand with a distinctive Scandinavian-sounding name that was entirely made up. The brand was created in 1961 by Reuben and Rose Mattus, Jewish-American immigrants from Poland. Reuben Mattus chose the fake Danish-sounding name as a tribute to Denmark's treatment of Jews during World War II - Denmark was the only occupied European country that actively rescued its Jewish population. The umlaut in the name has no linguistic meaning in any Scandinavian language. Starting from a Bronx kitchen, the Mattus family built Häagen-Dazs into the world's most recognized premium ice cream brand, selling it to Pillsbury in 1983. It is now owned by General Mills (in the US) and Froneri (a Nestlé joint venture outside the US). Häagen-Dazs operates in Israel and has faced BDS boycott pressure. The original Bronx factory has been the subject of nostalgic retrospectives about the brand's Jewish-American immigrant founding story.",

The seminary houses one of the greatest collections of Jewish manuscripts and rare books in the world, including fragments from the Cairo Genizah. JTS has shaped American Jewish life for over 135 years and represents the intellectual heart of Conservative Judaism, which was once the largest Jewish denomination in America. The seminary made the historic decision to ordain women as rabbis in 1983 and to ordain openly LGBTQ+ rabbis in 2007, both of which caused significant controversy within the Conservative movement.",

Jacobs is widely regarded as one of the most influential fashion designers of his generation. He served as creative director of Louis Vuitton from 1997 to 2014, transforming the luxury brand and pioneering high-fashion/streetwear collaborations. Jacobs grew up in a Jewish family and attended the High School of Art and Design and Parsons School of Design. His personal life has been marked by public battles with substance abuse (he entered rehab multiple times and got sober in 2007) and his openness about being gay, making him a prominent LGBTQ+ figure in fashion. The Marc Jacobs brand, owned by LVMH, has faced financial challenges with its main line while the more affordable Marc by Marc Jacobs line was popular before being discontinued.",

Under Hirshberg's leadership, Stonyfield grew from a small organic farming school into the world's largest organic yogurt brand. Hirshberg has been active in environmental causes, Democratic politics, and has spoken about how Jewish values of stewardship (tikkun olam) influence his approach to sustainable business. The company was sold to Groupe Danone in 2001, and later to Lactalis in 2014. Hirshberg has been controversially involved in opposing GMO labeling laws and has been criticized for some partnerships with conventional food companies.",

The organization used sophisticated polling and messaging techniques, employing Republican strategist Frank Luntz to develop messaging guides for pro-Israel advocates. TIP's \"Global Language Dictionary\" (leaked in 2009) became controversial as it appeared to be a playbook for how to spin media coverage of Israel. The organization was also criticized for its hawkish positions, including opposition to the Iran nuclear deal. TIP shut down in 2019, reportedly due to funding challenges and internal governance issues. Its legacy represents the professionalization of pro-Israel advocacy in American media.",

Founded in 1986 by Martin Cohen and Robert Steers in New York City. Martin Cohen, a Jewish-American investment manager, and Robert Steers pioneered the concept of investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) as a distinct asset class. The firm manages over $80 billion in assets and is publicly traded on the NYSE. Cohen & Steers played a pivotal role in establishing REITs as a mainstream investment category, enabling average investors to participate in real estate markets. The firm's dual Jewish-Gentile founding partnership is emblematic of Wall Street's evolution toward meritocracy.",

He developed the sound-on-film technology (Movietone) that competed with Warner Bros.' Vitaphone. Fox lost control of his company during the Great Depression. Darryl Zanuck, while not Jewish himself, was deeply connected to the Jewish film community and ran the studio for decades, producing classics like The Grapes of Wrath, All About Eve, and The Sound of Music. The studio was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in 1985 and later by Disney in 2019 for $71.3 billion.",

The name \"Häagen-Dazs\" is entirely fabricated - the Mattuses created a Scandinavian-sounding name to convey an image of Old World craftsmanship and purity, even including a map of Denmark on early packaging. The brand pioneered the super-premium ice cream category, using only the finest natural ingredients. Reuben Mattus was a committed Zionist, and the brand's early growth was supported by Jewish community networks. Häagen-Dazs was sold to Pillsbury in 1983 and is now owned by General Mills. The brand generates over $2 billion in annual global sales.",

Born in Brooklyn to a Jewish family, Epstein taught at the Dalton School before joining Bear Stearns in 1976, where he became a limited partner. He founded his own firm, J. Epstein & Co., in 1982, claiming to manage money exclusively for billionaires. His primary known client was Leslie Wexner, founder of L Brands (Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works), who granted Epstein sweeping power of attorney and gifted him a $77 million Manhattan townhouse - one of the largest private residences in New York. Epstein cultivated relationships with presidents (Bill Clinton, Donald Trump), princes (Prince Andrew), prime ministers, Nobel laureates, tech moguls, and Hollywood figures. He was first arrested in 2006 in Palm Beach, Florida, for soliciting prostitution from minors. A controversial 2008 plea deal negotiated by Alexander Acosta (later Trump's Labor Secretary) allowed Epstein to plead to state charges and serve just 13 months with work release. In July 2019, Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges. He was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 2019, with his death ruled a suicide by hanging - a conclusion widely disputed. His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on five of six charges of sex trafficking. Epstein's estate was valued at over $634 million. The full scope of his financial operations, intelligence connections, and the source of his wealth remain subjects of intense speculation and investigation.",

The connection to Jeffrey Epstein is central to understanding both the brand and the Epstein network: Wexner gave Epstein sweeping power of attorney over his finances, and Epstein reportedly used his association with the lingerie brand to recruit young women by posing as a talent scout. Wexner was Epstein's primary financial patron, transferring his Manhattan townhouse (valued at $77 million) to Epstein. In 2019, Wexner claimed Epstein had misappropriated vast sums of his money. The company went through major restructuring following the Epstein scandal and #MeToo movement, eventually dropping the Angels fashion show format.",

Born in Seattle, Washington, Gates grew up in an upper-middle-class family; his father William H. Gates Sr. was a prominent attorney, and his mother Mary Maxwell Gates served on the board of First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates dropped out of Harvard University in 1975 to co-found Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen. Under his leadership, Microsoft became the world's most valuable company, and Gates became the world's wealthiest person (a position he held for many years). Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO in 2000, as chairman in 2014, and from the board in 2020. His personal fortune, managed through Cascade Investment LLC, is estimated at $130 billion. In the Epstein context, Gates' relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has been extensively documented. Gates met Epstein multiple times starting in 2011 - three years after Epstein's first sex offense conviction. The New York Times reported that Gates flew on Epstein's Lolita Express in 2013, visited Epstein's Manhattan townhouse numerous times between 2011 and 2014, and stayed late into the night on multiple occasions. Email correspondence showed that Epstein proposed a multibillion-dollar global health charitable fund involving the Gates Foundation and JPMorgan Chase. Gates Foundation employees including Boris Nikolic attended meetings with Epstein. Nikolic was later named as a backup executor of Epstein's will, which came as a reported surprise to him. Melinda French Gates told CBS in 2022 that she was \"furious\" about Bill's relationship with Epstein and that it was one of several factors in their May 2021 divorce. Gates initially downplayed the relationship, telling The Wall Street Journal in 2019 that he \"didn't have any business relationship or friendship with\" Epstein - a characterization he later revised, acknowledging the meetings were a mistake. Separately, Microsoft founder Paul Allen's estate and investment firm Vulcan also had contact with Epstein circles. Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn (acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 billion in 2016), apologized in 2019 for helping arrange meetings between Epstein and MIT Media Lab's Joi Ito.",

In 2019, Wexner claimed Epstein had misappropriated vast sums of his wealth, though the full extent remains unclear.

The project was abruptly dissolved on July 12, 2019 - just six days after Jeffrey Epstein's arrest on federal sex trafficking charges. Critics and investigators have suggested the organization served primarily as a vehicle for Maxwell to maintain a veneer of philanthropic respectability and to facilitate networking with wealthy and powerful individuals.

Brunel had a long history of sexual abuse allegations in the modeling industry dating back to the 1980s, detailed in a 1988 CBS 60 Minutes investigation. Despite this, he continued to operate with impunity across multiple countries. MC2 was created in 2005 with financial backing from Epstein, who provided the agency's startup capital and office space. Through MC2, Brunel supplied Epstein with a pipeline of young models, many from Eastern Europe, South America, and developing countries, who were promised modeling careers. Virginia Giuffre alleged she was forced to have sex with Brunel on multiple occasions and that Brunel also trafficked three 12-year-old girls from France as a \"birthday gift\" for Epstein. Flight records show Brunel took over 70 flights on Epstein's aircraft. He was arrested in Paris in December 2020 on charges of rape of minors and sexual harassment. On February 19, 2022, Brunel was found hanged in his cell at La Sante prison in Paris while awaiting trial - his death mirroring the circumstances of Epstein's own death in custody. The French investigation continued posthumously.",

In practice, Epstein's only known major client was Leslie Wexner, the founder of L Brands (Victoria's Secret). The true nature and extent of the firm's business operations remain one of the central mysteries of the Epstein case. Despite claiming to manage billions, no former clients (besides Wexner) have been publicly identified or come forward. Epstein held power of attorney over Wexner's finances and was trustee of Wexner's personal trust. Through this relationship, Epstein gained control of Wexner's $77 million Manhattan townhouse (the largest private residence in New York) and flew on the Wexner corporate jet. After Epstein's 2019 death, his estate was valued at over $634 million, but the sources of his wealth remain unexplained by legitimate financial advisory work alone.

Staley resigned from Barclays in November 2021 after the FCA concluded he had been misleading about the nature and extent of his Epstein ties. JPMorgan's own internal communications revealed that Staley referred to Epstein as a \"rock star\" and discussed bringing him back as a client even after the 2008 conviction.

The foundation operates the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), and other programs focused on global health, economic development, and climate change. Jeffrey Epstein made a $25,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation. More significantly, Epstein's connections to Clinton extended well beyond charitable giving: flight logs showed Clinton took at least 26 trips on Epstein's private Boeing 727 (nicknamed the \"Lolita Express\"), and Clinton visited Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands at least once. Ghislaine Maxwell was photographed at Chelsea Clinton's wedding in 2010 and attended Clinton Global Initiative events. The foundation has raised over $2 billion from individuals, corporations, and foreign governments, attracting scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.",

For decades, Weinstein was one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, producing films that collectively earned over 300 Academy Award nominations. In October 2017, The New York Times and The New Yorker published investigations revealing decades of sexual harassment, assault, and rape allegations against Weinstein by over 80 women, including prominent actresses. His downfall catalyzed the global #MeToo movement. He was convicted in 2020 in New York and sentenced to 23 years (later overturned on appeal in 2024), then convicted again in Los Angeles in 2022 and sentenced to 16 years. Weinstein was connected to Jeffrey Epstein through New York social circles. Both were clients of high-powered attorneys and moved in overlapping elite networks. The Weinstein and Epstein scandals together exposed systemic patterns of predation enabled by wealth, power, and institutional complicity.",

Through Edge.org, Brockman published the annual \"Edge Question\" and organized exclusive dinners connecting the world's top minds. Brockman served as a critical node connecting Jeffrey Epstein to the scientific establishment. He organized and hosted \"billionaires' dinners\" where Epstein met and cultivated relationships with prominent scientists including Steven Pinker, Daniel Kahneman, and others. After Epstein's 2019 arrest, internal Brockman emails obtained by media revealed him referring to Epstein as \"my friend\" and describing Epstein's Manhattan townhouse as a salon for the \"most interesting people in the world.\" In a 2013 email, Brockman wrote admiringly of Epstein's ability to convene top scientists and billionaires. The revelations forced Brockman to step back from Edge Foundation operations. Multiple scientists who received Epstein funding had been introduced through Brockman's network.",

Little St. James, infamously known as \"Pedophile Island\" or \"Orgy Island,\" contained Epstein's main residential compound, guest houses, a mysterious blue-and-white striped temple structure, and extensive security infrastructure. Flight logs of Epstein's Boeing 727 (tail number N908JE, nicknamed the \"Lolita Express\") and his Gulfstream revealed hundreds of trips carrying prominent guests to the island. Workers on the island described seeing young girls being brought by boat and plane. In 2020, the USVI Attorney General Denise George filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein's estate alleging sex trafficking on the islands spanning two decades. The lawsuit revealed that Epstein brought girls as young as 11 to the island. In 2023, JPMorgan Chase settled with the USVI for $75 million over its role in facilitating Epstein's operations. The islands were sold in 2023 for approximately $60 million to billionaire Stephen Deckoff.",

In 2011, following Epstein's 2008 conviction in Florida, the Manhattan DA's office was preparing to seek a court order requiring Epstein to register as a Level 3 sex offender (the highest risk category) in New York. However, Epstein's lawyers - including former Manhattan DA John Sweeney and former deputy DA Linda Fairstein - lobbied the DA's office. Ultimately, Vance's office asked the judge to downgrade Epstein to Level 1, the lowest risk designation. A Vance spokesman later said the office \"did not initiate\" the downgrade request but could not adequately explain why it argued for leniency. The revelation became a significant scandal for Vance's office. Separately, Vance chose not to pursue sexual assault charges against Harvey Weinstein in 2015 despite an NYPD sting operation that recorded Weinstein admitting to groping model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. Vance received a $10,000 campaign donation from Weinstein's lawyer shortly after declining to prosecute.",

The foundation has donated over $65 billion since inception. It is the largest private funder of the World Health Organization, giving it enormous influence over global health policy - a fact that has drawn both praise and criticism. The foundation was embroiled in the Epstein scandal when it was revealed that Gates had met with Epstein multiple times beginning in 2011 (three years after Epstein's first sex offense conviction). Emails showed that Epstein proposed a multibillion-dollar charitable fund with JPMorgan and the Gates Foundation, though this did not materialize. Boris Nikolic, a former science advisor to Gates, was named as a backup executor of Epstein's will - a fact that surprised Nikolic according to his spokesperson. Melinda French Gates stated that Bill's relationship with Epstein was one factor in their 2021 divorce. The foundation has granted money to organizations worldwide and has been criticized for its influence over public health and education policy, agricultural practices in developing nations, and media (having donated over $300 million to media organizations).",

This apparent conflict - championing sex assault victims in one case while using aggressive tactics against them in another - was extensively reported by Ronan Farrow in his book \"Catch and Kill.\" Boies also represented the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and had previously been counsel for CBS.

        "description": "Lesley Groff served as Jeffrey Epstein's executive assistant for approximately 20 years, managing his complex schedule, travel arrangements, and communications. She was one of four women identified as \"potential co-conspirators\" in Epstein's 2008 non-prosecution agreement but was never charged. Groff's role in the Epstein operation was primarily organizational - she arranged visits, travel, and logistics that facilitated Epstein's access to young women and his meetings with powerful figures. Court documents and victim testimony describe Groff as the gatekeeper who scheduled \"massages\" (Epstein's euphemism for sexual encounters with young women) at his various properties. Despite being named as a potential co-conspirator, Groff received immunity under the controversial plea deal negotiated by Alexander Acosta. She continued to work for Epstein after his 2008 conviction and until his 2019 arrest. She settled civil lawsuits brought by Epstein victims.",

Founded in 1999 by Charles Bronfman (of the Jewish-Canadian Bronfman family) and Michael Steinhardt (a prominent Jewish-American hedge fund manager). The program has brought over 800,000 young Jews from 68 countries to Israel. Birthright is funded by a partnership between the Israeli government, private Jewish donors, and Jewish communities worldwide. Major donors include Sheldon Adelson (who donated over $400 million before his death) and the Bronfman and Steinhardt families. The program has been controversial: critics accuse it of being a propaganda tool that presents a one-sided view of Israel without exposing participants to Palestinian perspectives, of \"birthright washing\" the occupation, and of being designed to increase support for Israel and promote Jewish marriage. Michael Steinhardt was also accused of sexually harassing young women, leading to his departure from the board.",

The company had a landmark IPO in 2014 and was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017 - at the time the largest acquisition of an Israeli tech company ever. Intel took Mobileye public again in 2022 at a $17 billion valuation. Amnon Shashua, an Israeli-Jewish computer scientist, is one of the most celebrated entrepreneurs in Israeli tech history. Mobileye represents one of the proudest achievements of the \"Startup Nation\" narrative. The company's technology has been controversial in the autonomous driving debate, particularly after the severance of its relationship with Tesla in 2016 following a fatal accident involving Tesla's Autopilot.",

Founded in 1998, Partner became one of Israel's three major mobile operators alongside Pelephone and Cellcom. The company's entire identity is Israeli: it is listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and NASDAQ and is one of Israel's core telecommunications infrastructure providers, serving millions of Israeli subscribers. Partner faced a major controversy in 2015 when Orange S.A.'s CEO Stéphane Richard publicly expressed a desire to terminate the brand licensing agreement, widely interpreted as yielding to BDS pressure. This led to a diplomatic incident between Israel and France, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu condemning the move. The episode became a landmark case in corporate responses to anti-Israel boycott pressure. Israeli billionaire Haim Saban publicly condemned Orange.",

        "description": "Tesco plc is the largest supermarket chain in the United Kingdom and one of the largest retailers in the world. The company was founded in 1919 by Jack Cohen (born Jacob Edward Kohen), a Jewish East London market stallholder who began selling surplus groceries. Cohen was the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants. The name \"Tesco\" came from the initials of tea supplier T.E. Stockwell combined with Cohen's surname. Under Cohen's son-in-law Leslie Porter and successive leaders, Tesco grew into a multinational retail giant operating in multiple countries. The Porter family's Jewish philanthropic connections are extensive. Tesco faced a major accounting scandal in 2014 when it overstated profits by 326 million pounds; three executives were charged (later acquitted). The company also faced criticism for its aggressive expansion that led to the closure of independent shops across the UK. Leslie Porter, who served as Westminster City Council leader, was involved in the \"homes for votes\" gerrymandering scandal. Tesco operates extensively and faced controversies around products sourced from Israeli settlements.",

The BBC's relationship with Israel and Jewish communities has been extensively debated. Critics, particularly from pro-Israel advocates and organizations including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and CAMERA UK, have accused the BBC of systematic bias against Israel in its Middle East reporting. The BBC's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been the subject of multiple internal reviews and external investigations, including the 2004 Balen Report (which the BBC fought to suppress). In October 2023, the BBC was widely criticized for initially refusing to call Hamas attackers \"terrorists.\" Conversely, pro-Palestinian advocates have accused the BBC of pro-Israel bias. The BBC has employed prominent Jewish journalists and executives throughout its history. During WWII, the BBC's Hebrew Service broadcast to Palestine and the Jewish world. The corporation has faced additional controversies including the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, equal pay lawsuits, and license fee debates.",

The company has employed Israeli engineers and has connections to the Israeli fintech ecosystem. Storonsky, born in Russia to a family with banking connections (his father was a director at Gazprom Neft), has built Revolut into one of Europe's most valuable fintech companies (valued at $33 billion in 2024). Controversies include a 2018 compliance scandal (employees alleged the company turned off sanctions screening systems), toxic work culture allegations, high employee turnover, and delays in obtaining its UK banking license (finally granted in 2024).",

Robert Maxwell was a Labour MP, media baron (Mirror Group Newspapers, Macmillan Publishers), and alleged Mossad asset who died under mysterious circumstances in 1991 when he fell from his yacht Lady Ghislaine off the Canary Islands. After his death, it was revealed he had stolen over 400 million pounds from Mirror Group pension funds. Ghislaine moved to New York City in 1991 and quickly became a prominent figure in Manhattan high society. She began a romantic relationship with Jeffrey Epstein in the early 1990s, and even after their intimate relationship ended, she remained his closest associate. She was central to Epstein's operation: recruiting, grooming, and trafficking underage girls. In December 2021, she was convicted on five of six counts of aiding Epstein's sex trafficking, including sex trafficking of a minor. She was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison in June 2022. Victims described her as the \"lady of the house\" who normalized abuse and directly participated in it. She maintains her innocence and has appealed. The Maxwell family's connections to intelligence services (Robert Maxwell's alleged links to MI6, the KGB, and Mossad) have fueled extensive speculation about the intelligence dimensions of the Epstein operation.",

One of the original \"Big Six\" supermodels of the 1990s, Campbell has appeared on over 500 magazine covers. She was among the guests who appeared on Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs. Campbell was photographed with Ghislaine Maxwell at various social events. Campbell's name appeared in Epstein's contact book, and flight records show she took trips on Epstein's private aircraft. While Campbell has not been accused of any wrongdoing, her presence in Epstein's orbit illustrates the breadth of his social circle across the entertainment, fashion, and high-society worlds. Campbell also has connections to other controversial figures, having accepted a \"blood diamond\" gift from former Liberian President Charles Taylor in 1997 (she testified about this at Taylor's war crimes trial in 2010). She founded Fashion for Relief in 2005 for charitable purposes, though the UK Charity Commission later found serious misconduct in the charity's operations.",

The Marks family's Jewish heritage profoundly influenced the company's culture of social responsibility, fair treatment of employees, and product quality. Simon Marks (Michael's son) and Israel Sieff (his brother-in-law, also Jewish) transformed M&S into a national institution. The Sieff family were prominent Zionists - Israel Sieff was president of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. M&S has been a persistent BDS target due to its founders' Zionist connections and the company's sourcing of some products from Israel. Lord Marcus Sieff, who led M&S from 1972 to 1984, was a strong supporter of Israel and friend of Chaim Weizmann. The Marks and Sieff families represent one of the most significant Jewish business dynasties in British history.",

France has one of the most developed Jewish school systems outside of Israel, with dozens of Jewish day schools across the country. Jewish education in France has become increasingly important as the community faces rising antisemitism, with many families choosing Jewish schools for both educational quality and physical security after a series of attacks including the 2012 Toulouse Jewish school shooting that killed a rabbi and three children (including two of his own). The French Jewish educational system produces students who are fluent in French, Hebrew, and often English, with strong connections to both French and Israeli culture.",

During the Nazi era, Deutsche Bank played a central role in the Aryanization of Jewish-owned businesses, helping to force Jewish owners to sell enterprises at far below market value. The bank financed the construction of Auschwitz and used slave labor. In a 1999 settlement, Deutsche Bank contributed to a $5.2 billion fund for slave labor victims. In recent decades, the bank has faced numerous scandals including a $7.2 billion settlement for selling toxic mortgage securities (2017), a $2.5 billion fine for LIBOR rate manipulation (2015), involvement in Russian mirror trading ($10 billion money laundering scheme), and its controversial banking relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump. The bank's Israeli operations include offices in Tel Aviv. Former CEO Josef Ackermann (2002-2012) and current CEO Christian Sewing have attempted to reform the bank's culture. Paul Achleitner, the former chairman of the supervisory board (2012-2022), is of partial Jewish descent.",

It represents approximately 100,000-120,000 Jews in more than 100 Jewish communities across Germany. The community experienced dramatic growth after German reunification (1990) when Germany accepted approximately 200,000 Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The Central Council advises the German government on Jewish affairs and combats antisemitism, which has been rising in Germany from both far-right extremists and some immigrant communities. The council's existence is itself remarkable - the representative body of Jews living in the land of the perpetrators, navigating the complex moral and historical terrain of German-Jewish relations in the post-Holocaust era.",

The existence of Maccabi in Germany carries profound significance given the country's history - the original German Maccabi movement, founded in the early 20th century, was destroyed by the Nazis. Many Maccabi athletes were murdered in the Holocaust. The revival of Maccabi Germany after World War II represents the broader rebuilding of Jewish life in Germany. Today, Maccabi Germany fields teams in various sports and sends athletes to the European Maccabi Games and the Maccabiah Games in Israel. The organization serves Germany's growing Jewish community (approximately 120,000-200,000 members, boosted by immigration from the former Soviet Union after 1990). Maccabi Germany's story embodies resilience - Jewish athletes competing under the Maccabi name in the land where Maccabi athletes were once murdered.",

Given South Africa's own history of systemic racism, the SAHGF's programming resonates deeply, using the Holocaust as a lens to examine prejudice, human rights, and the responsibilities of citizenship. The foundation's centers host thousands of students annually. Nelson Mandela himself drew explicit connections between the Nazi persecution of Jews and apartheid, and many Jewish South Africans were prominent anti-apartheid activists. The SAHGF has been involved in debates about whether the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be included in its genocide education.",

The museum uniquely connects the Holocaust to the South African experience of apartheid and other genocides including Rwanda, Armenia, and Cambodia. It uses personal testimonies and artifacts from the approximately 500 Holocaust survivors who settled in Cape Town after World War II. The museum serves as a major educational institution, reaching over 30,000 students annually and training teachers across Southern Africa. It is particularly significant in the South African context, where parallels between Nazi racial ideology and apartheid resonate deeply. The museum also addresses contemporary issues of xenophobia, racism, and human rights in South Africa.",

Opened in 2000, the museum documents the Holocaust through exhibits, archives, survivor testimonies, and educational programs. Buenos Aires has particular significance in Holocaust history: Argentina became a notorious haven for Nazi war criminals, including Adolf Eichmann (who was captured by Mossad agents in Buenos Aires in 1960 in one of the most dramatic intelligence operations in history), Josef Mengele, and Erich Priebke. The museum addresses this dark chapter of Argentine history. It also memorializes the approximately 1,500-3,000 Jewish Argentines disappeared during the military dictatorship (1976-1983) and the AMIA bombing victims (1994, 85 killed).",

The museum was built with significant funding from Russian-Jewish oligarchs and was endorsed by President Vladimir Putin, who donated a month of his salary. Russia has a complex relationship with its Jewish population: it was home to the largest Jewish community in the world before the Revolution, but Jews faced centuries of pogroms, the Pale of Settlement, blood libels, and ultimately the Soviet suppression of Jewish culture. Many of Russia's Jews played prominent roles in the Bolshevik Revolution (Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev) before Stalin's purges targeted Jewish intellectuals. Today approximately 150,000-200,000 Jews remain in Russia.",

Rich's business partner Pincus Green, also Jewish, was co-indicted and co-pardoned. Ivan Glasenberg, a Jewish South African, served as CEO from 2002 to 2021, making Glencore the world's dominant commodity trader. Current CEO Gary Nagle succeeded Glasenberg.

In 1998, UBS and Credit Suisse agreed to pay $1.25 billion to settle Holocaust victims' claims. In modern times, UBS has Israeli operations and a significant Israeli client base. UBS was fined $3.7 billion by France for helping wealthy French clients evade taxes, and paid $780 million to the US DOJ for helping Americans evade taxes.

The company has been one of the most protested corporations in history - the Nestlé boycott over infant formula marketing in developing countries (accused of causing infant deaths by discouraging breastfeeding) has run since the 1970s.

Founded in 1999, the network promotes cultural tourism, heritage preservation, and historical education around Spain's medieval Jewish past. Spain was home to one of the largest and most culturally significant Jewish communities in world history, producing figures like Maimonides, Judah Halevi, and Abraham Ibn Ezra. The 1492 expulsion by Ferdinand and Isabella ended centuries of Jewish life, but the physical heritage remains in remarkable synagogues, ritual baths, and urban layouts across cities like Toledo, Cordoba, Girona, Segovia, and Hervas. The network has developed cultural routes, guided tours, and interpretive centers.",

Located in a complex of four former Ashkenazi synagogues dating to the 17th-18th centuries in Amsterdam's historic Jewish Quarter, the museum presents the history of Jews in the Netherlands from 1600 to the present. Amsterdam was once known as the \"Jerusalem of the West\" due to its enormous Jewish community - at its peak, Jews constituted about 13% of the city's population. The museum covers the Golden Age when Jews fleeing the Iberian Inquisition found refuge in tolerant Amsterdam, the devastating Holocaust (75% of Dutch Jews were murdered - the highest percentage in Western Europe), and the rebuilding of Jewish life after the war. The museum complex includes the Portuguese Synagogue (built in 1675), one of the most beautiful synagogues in the world, and the National Holocaust Memorial of Names (inaugurated in 2021, listing all 102,000 Dutch Holocaust victims).",

The company merged its content operations with Univision in 2022 to form TelevisaUnivision. Mexican Jewish business families, including the Slim family, have had investments and business dealings with Televisa. The company has faced controversies including allegations of bribery connected to FIFA (related to broadcasting rights), coverage bias favoring the ruling PRI party for decades, and disputes over its monopolistic position in Mexican media.",

Freud, born to Galician Jewish parents, is one of the most influential intellectual figures of the 20th century, having founded psychoanalysis and profoundly shaped modern understanding of the human mind.

The attack sent shockwaves through the European Jewish community and highlighted the growing threat of Islamist antisemitic terrorism in Europe. The museum covers Belgian Jewish history including the prosperous pre-war Antwerp diamond community (largely Jewish), the Holocaust in Belgium (over 25,000 Belgian Jews were deported, mostly to Auschwitz), and contemporary Jewish life. Belgium's Jewish community numbers approximately 30,000-40,000, concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp (which has a large Orthodox and Hasidic community centered around the diamond industry).",

The Antwerp Jewish community is renowned worldwide as the center of the global diamond trade, with the Diamond District (Diamantwijk) dominated by Orthodox and Hasidic Jews for over a century. CCOJB advocates for the community on political and security issues, combats antisemitism, and maintains relationships with the Belgian government. The organization has dealt with significant challenges including the 2014 Jewish Museum shooting, the rise of antisemitism in Belgium, and the regional ban on halal and kosher slaughter in Flanders and Wallonia - a law that Jewish and Muslim communities have challenged as an infringement on religious freedom.",

Alibaba's Israeli connections are significant: the company established Alibaba Innovation Lab in Tel Aviv in 2018, and its investment arm has funded multiple Israeli startups in AI, cybersecurity, and semiconductors. Israeli venture capital firms including Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) and Pitango have facilitated partnerships between Israeli tech companies and Alibaba. Joe Tsai (Cai Chongxin), co-founder and executive chairman, has extensive financial connections including ownership of the Brooklyn Nets and investments managed through Jewish-American financial networks. Alibaba invested in Israeli augmented reality company Infinity AR (acquired 2019) and Israeli QR code company Visualead (acquired 2017). Jack Ma visited Israel in 2018 and praised Israeli innovation. The company has faced controversies including antitrust fines of $2.8 billion by Chinese regulators (2021), Jack Ma's public clash with Chinese regulators leading to the suspension of Ant Group's IPO, and allegations of a culture enabling sexual misconduct (2021 assault allegations).",

On September 29-30, 1941, Nazi German Einsatzgruppen and their local collaborators murdered 33,771 Jewish men, women, and children at the Babi Yar ravine on the outskirts of Kyiv - the largest single mass shooting of the Holocaust. Over the subsequent months, an estimated 100,000-150,000 additional Jews, Roma, Soviet POWs, and others were killed at the site. Despite the massive scale of the atrocity, the Soviet Union suppressed the specifically Jewish nature of the massacre for decades, turning the site into a Soviet generic war memorial. The modern memorial center, which broke ground in 2021 with renewed international attention (funded in part by Ukrainian-Jewish oligarchs), aims to create a world-class memorial and educational center. The project has been complicated by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and by controversies over governance and historical narratives.",

The Coral Temple survived the war and continued to serve as the spiritual center of Bucharest's Jewish community. Today, Romania's Jewish population has dwindled to approximately 3,000-5,000 members due to the Holocaust, Communist-era emigration to Israel, and post-1989 emigration.

After the expulsion, the building was successively used as a prison, chapel, hay barn, and warehouse. It was rediscovered as a synagogue in 1920 and has been classified as a National Monument. Today it houses the Abraão Zacuto Luso-Hebraic Museum, named after the famous Jewish astronomer and mathematician who served the Portuguese crown. The synagogue is a powerful symbol of the once-flourishing Jewish community of Portugal (the Sephardim), which was destroyed by forced conversion and the Inquisition but whose cultural legacy has been increasingly recognized by modern Portugal, including through its 2015 law granting citizenship to descendants of expelled Sephardim.",

The museum preserves this history through documents, photographs, personal artifacts, and survivor testimonies. It also documents the contributions of Latvian Jews to the country's cultural, economic, and intellectual life. Today approximately 6,000-9,000 Jews live in Latvia, primarily in Riga.",

Additionally, thousands of Jews from other countries were brought to Estonian concentration camps (including Klooga and Vaivara) and murdered. Today's Estonian Jewish community was largely rebuilt by Soviet-era immigrants, particularly from Russia and Ukraine.

Montenegro's Jewish history includes Sephardic Jews who settled in the Bay of Kotor after the 1492 Spanish Expulsion, establishing a community in cities like Kotor, Budva, and Podgorica. During World War II, Italian-occupied Montenegro provided some protection to Jews until the German occupation in 1943, after which Jews were deported and murdered. Today's community is active in preserving Jewish heritage, maintaining the Kotor Jewish cemetery, and educating about Jewish history in the region. Montenegro was the last European country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel (in 2006 when it became independent). The tiny community hosts cultural events and is involved in interfaith dialogue in the multi-ethnic Balkans.",
