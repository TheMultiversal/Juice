Zukor founded Famous Players Film Company in 1912, which became Paramount Pictures. He pioneered the feature-length film format and the star system, signing Mary Pickford and other early film legends. Jesse L. Lasky (Jewish) co-founded the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, which merged with Zukor's company. Zukor led Paramount for decades, living to age 103. Under Barney Balaban (Jewish), Paramount became one of the most profitable studios. The studio's history exemplifies the Jewish immigrant experience in building Hollywood from nothing.",

Marcus Sieff and other members of the founding family led the company for decades and were deeply involved in the Zionist movement - Sieff was president of the World Zionist Organization. M&S became a quintessentially British institution, known for quality food and clothing, with over 1,000 stores worldwide. The company has been targeted by BDS boycotts due to the founding family's Zionist connections, despite being a publicly traded company.",
