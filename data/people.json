Epstein & Co in 1982, claiming to only serve billionaires - his only known major client was Leslie Wexner. Arrested in 2006 in Palm Beach for soliciting a minor. Negotiated a lenient plea deal in 2008 under U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, serving 13 months in county jail with work release. Re-arrested July 6, 2019 by SDNY on federal sex trafficking charges. His Manhattan townhouse was reportedly the largest private residence in NYC - originally owned by Wexner. Found dead in Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 2019, officially ruled suicide by hanging, though circumstances remain highly disputed (broken cameras, sleeping guards, broken hyoid bone). His black book contained contact information for hundreds of prominent people. Flight logs of his private jet (dubbed the \"Lolita Express\") showed trips to his private island in the US Virgin Islands (Little St. James), his ranch in New Mexico, and residences worldwide.",
